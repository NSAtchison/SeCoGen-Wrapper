```python
import hashlib
import getpass
import os

# Securely store the password hash.  In a real application, this would be in a database.
#  For this example, we'll use an environment variable.  NEVER do this in production!
PASSWORD_HASH = os.environ.get("PASSWORD_HASH")

# If the environment variable isn't set, exit with an error
if not PASSWORD_HASH:
    print("Error: PASSWORD_HASH environment variable not set.")
    exit(1)


def check_password(username, password):
    # Check if username matches (in a real system, this would be a database lookup)
    if username != "admin":
        return False

    # Hash the input password and compare to the stored hash
    salt, stored_hash = PASSWORD_HASH.split('$', 1)  #assuming salt and hash separated by $
    salted_password = salt + password
    hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(salted_password.encode()).hexdigest()

    return hashed_password == stored_hash

def main():
    username = input("Username: ")
    password = getpass.getpass("Password: ")

    if check_password(username, password):
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Login failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**To use this code:**

1. **Generate a secure salt and hash:** Before running, you MUST generate a secure salt and hash for the password "password".  Use a strong random salt (at least 16 characters) and a strong hashing algorithm like SHA-256 (as used above).  Example using Python:

```python
import hashlib
import os
import base64

password = "password"
salt = base64.b64encode(os.urandom(16)).decode('utf-8') # Generate a random salt
salted_password = salt + password
hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(salted_password.encode()).hexdigest()
PASSWORD_HASH = f"{salt}${hashed_password}"
print(f"Set the environment variable PASSWORD_HASH to: {PASSWORD_HASH}")
```


2. **Set the environment variable:** Set the `PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable to the output from step 1.  How you do this depends on your operating system (e.g.,  `export PASSWORD_HASH="..."` on Linux/macOS, `set PASSWORD_HASH="..."` on Windows).


**Security Report:**

The original code had a critical vulnerability: the password was hardcoded. The revised code addresses this by:

* **Hashing the password:**  The password is now hashed using SHA-256 before comparison.  This means that even if the database is compromised, the actual password isn't revealed; only the hash is exposed.  Recovering the password from the hash is computationally infeasible.

* **Salting the password:** A randomly generated salt is prepended to the password *before* hashing. This is crucial because it prevents rainbow table attacks – pre-computed tables of password hashes.  Each user gets a unique salt, making rainbow tables ineffective.

* **Storing the hash securely (in this example, using an environment variable):** The hash is stored in the `PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable.  **However, this is for demonstration purposes ONLY.** In a production environment, passwords should NEVER be stored in environment variables.  Instead, they should be stored in a secure, encrypted database with appropriate access controls.

* **Username Verification:** The code still performs a simple username check.  In a real-world scenario, this would involve querying a database to verify the username and retrieve the corresponding password hash.

**Remaining Security Considerations:**

* **Database Security:**  The biggest remaining security risk is the method of storing the password hash.  A real application *must* use a robust database with strong encryption at rest and in transit.

* **Input Validation:**  The code lacks input validation.  It should check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (if used with a database) and other attacks.

* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

* **HTTPS:**  If this authentication is used in a web application, HTTPS is absolutely essential.

* **Stronger Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies, including length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.

* **Session Management:**  For web applications, proper session management is critical to prevent session hijacking.

In short, while the improved code is significantly more secure than the original, it's still a simplified example.  Building a truly secure authentication system requires careful consideration of many more factors.  Using established libraries and frameworks designed for authentication will greatly improve security.
