security report below.**  For real-world applications, consider using a dedicated authentication system and database.




To use this code:

1.  **Create `credentials.txt`:**  Before running the script, create a file named `credentials.txt` in the same directory.  The file should contain the username and the SHA-256 hash of the password, separated by a colon (e.g.,  `admin:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`).  **You MUST hash your password using the `hash_password` function before placing it in the file.**

**Security Report:**

This improved code is significantly more secure than the original but still has vulnerabilities:

*   **Salt Storage:** The salt ("some_random_salt") is hardcoded.  In a real system, the salt should be randomly generated for each user and stored securely (ideally alongside the hashed password in a database using appropriate encryption).  A compromised salt renders the hashing useless.

*   **Credentials File Security:**  The `credentials.txt` file itself is a security risk.  Anyone with access to the file can obtain the hashed password.  This file needs to be protected with appropriate file permissions (e.g., only the owner should have read access).  Furthermore, storing credentials in a plain text file is strongly discouraged.

*   **No Input Validation:** The code still lacks input validation.  A malicious user could try to inject code or exploit vulnerabilities through crafted input.

*   **Single Hashing Algorithm:**  Using only SHA-256 is not ideal.  Stronger methods like bcrypt or Argon2 are recommended because they are designed to be computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.

*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The error handling in `load_credentials` is basic. More robust error handling should be included to prevent potential information leaks or crashes.


*   **No Session Management:**  After successful login, there's no session management.  An attacker could potentially steal the username/password hash from memory.

**To make this code truly secure, you need to address these issues by:**

1.  Using a robust password hashing library (like `bcrypt` or `argon2`) that handles salt generation and storage securely.
2.  Storing credentials in a secure database with appropriate access controls.
3.  Implementing robust input validation and sanitization.
4.  Adding session management to prevent unauthorized access.
5.  Using a secure framework or library designed for authentication.


This example serves as a basic illustration of moving away from hardcoded credentials.  For production systems, consider using established authentication libraries and following best security practices.
