## Wrapper Test

This directory contains the results of a test run of SeCoGen. This is the same test run that was described during our final presentation for this project.

It can be noted that the pass 1 code contains variables that suggest the use of hardcoded passwords, and that vulnerability is reflected in the pass 1 Bandit report. The issue is solved in the final code and bandit report, and the security report describes the improvement made and contains valuable suggestions for the user.
