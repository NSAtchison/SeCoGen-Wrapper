This improved code addresses the issue of hardcoded passwords by storing a password hash in a separate file.  This is still not ideal for a production environment (a proper database with salting and peppering would be necessary), but significantly improves security over hardcoding.


```python
import hashlib
import getpass
import os

def get_password_hash(filename="password.hash"):
    """Retrieves the password hash from a file.  Creates the file if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            hashed_password = f.readline().strip()
            return hashed_password
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Password file not found. Please set a password.")
        set_password(filename)  # Call the function to create and save the password hash
        return get_password_hash(filename)  # Call the function recursively to load the newly created password hash


def set_password(filename="password.hash"):
    """Sets a new password, hashes it, and saves it to a file."""
    while True:
        password = getpass.getpass("Enter new password: ")
        confirm_password = getpass.getpass("Confirm new password: ")
        if password == confirm_password:
            hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()  #Uses SHA256 for hashing
            with open(filename, "w") as f:
                f.write(hashed_password)
            print("Password set successfully.")
            break
        else:
            print("Passwords do not match. Please try again.")


def check_credentials(username, password, hashed_password):
    """Checks username and password against the stored hash."""
    if username == "admin": #Still hardcodes username, this should be improved in real scenario.
        user_hashed_password = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
        return user_hashed_password == hashed_password
    else:
        return False


def main():
    username = input("Username: ")
    password = getpass.getpass("Password: ")
    stored_hash = get_password_hash()
    if check_credentials(username, password, stored_hash):
        print("Login successful!")
    else:
        print("Login failed.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**Security Report:**

This revised code is a significant improvement over the original, but still has limitations:

**Improvements:**

* **Password Hashing:** Passwords are now hashed using SHA256 before storage.  This makes it computationally infeasible to recover the original password even if the `password.hash` file is compromised.
* **No Hardcoded Passwords:** The actual password is not stored directly in the code.
* **Password Confirmation:** The `set_password` function includes password confirmation to reduce the risk of typos.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Storing the Hash in a File:**  The `password.hash` file is a single point of failure.  If this file is compromised, an attacker gains access.  In a real-world application, a secure database with proper access controls is essential.
* **Simple Username Check:** The username ("admin") is still hardcoded.  In a production system, usernames should be stored and verified securely (e.g., in a database).
* **Lack of Salting and Peppering:** The code only uses hashing.  Adding salt (random data unique to each password) and pepper (a secret key) significantly enhances security against rainbow table attacks and database breaches.
* **No Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate user inputs (e.g., checking for empty usernames or passwords).
* **File Permissions:** The `password.hash` file needs appropriate permissions (e.g., read-only for the application) to prevent unauthorized access.

**Recommendations for a Production System:**

1. **Use a Secure Database:** Store usernames, password hashes (with salt and pepper), and other user data in a robust database with appropriate security measures (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit).
2. **Implement Strong Authentication:** Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
3. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
4. **Input Validation:** Always validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Use a Secure Library:** For password hashing, consider using a well-vetted library designed for password storage that handles salting and peppering automatically.  This reduces the chances of implementation errors.
6. **Secure File Storage (if necessary):** If file storage is unavoidable, employ robust encryption and access control mechanisms.

This improved code provides a better foundation, but should be considered a stepping stone towards a fully secure authentication system suitable for deployment.  For anything beyond testing or simple, non-critical applications, it is essential to use proven security practices and tools.
